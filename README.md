# Megan's Guessing Game
## Class demo for 201n2 guessing game
This is a page that I made in Code201 to have ask a user questions about myself and see if they can answer correctly! The user is prompted with 5 questions and the final question will continue to prompt them until they guess correctly.
## What I learned:
The topics that I learned while writing this page were:
* how to prompt a user
* how to alert a user
* how to print to the console
* if/else statements
* separation of concerns
* while loops

Taylor helped me to implement my while loop using:

`var guessedRight = false;`

When the user guesses correctly the variable is set to `true` and the loop will stop prompting them.
